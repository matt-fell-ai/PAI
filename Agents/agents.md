# PAI Specialized Agents

## Overview
This directory contains Markdown definitions for specialized AI personalities. These files serve as the "Sustenance" for the `Swarm` skill, allowing the PAI to delegate tasks to the most qualified agent.

## Core Personalities
- **`Architect.md`**: High-level system design and 2030 strategic planning.
- **`Engineer.md`**: Technical implementation, debugging, and code optimization.
- **`Researcher.md`**: Multi-source information gathering and synthesis.
- **`Designer.md`**: Visual aesthetics, UI/UX logic, and multi-modal perception.
- **`Pentester.md`**: Security auditing, vulnerability research, and hardening.
- **`GeminiResearcher.md`**: Specialized agent utilizing Gemini 3.0 Pro's deep thinking.

## Delegation Pattern
Agents are invoked via the PAI's internal delegation logic or the `Swarm` skill.

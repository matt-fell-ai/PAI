# PAI 2030: The Comprehensive User Guide

Congratulations. You have initialized the most advanced Personal AI Infrastructure in existence. This guide will help you master the 12 pillars of your sovereign system.

---

## 1. The Core Philosophy: Logic-Over-Art
PAI is built on the principle that **Scaffolding > Model**. A small model (8B) wrapped in PAI's **Intelligence-Amplification Scaffolding (IAS)** will consistently outperform a massive model (70B) that lacks structured cognitive loops.

---

## 2. The 12 Pillars of Capability

### 1. CORE (The Scaffolding)
Your PAI's fundamental operating rules and IAS reasoning loop. It ensures that every request is Reasoned, Executed, and Verified.

### 2. REVENUE (The Engine)
Finds leads via **Alpha**, builds products via **Forge**, and closes deals via **Closer**. This is your profit-generating machine.

### 3. CYBER (The Shield)
Advanced OSINT (**Ghost**), vulnerability scanning (**Specter**), and system hardening (**Bastion**).

### 4. ECONOMY (The Market)
Handles agent-to-agent payments via the **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)** and registers your ideas as IP via **Story Protocol**.

### 5. SENSES (The Perception)
Gives your PAI eyes (**Iris**) and ears (**Echo**/**Voice**). It "sees" your screen and "hears" your meeting notes.

### 6. AUTONOMY (The Partner)
Proactive suggestions via **Oracle** and background task execution via **Shadow**. PAI works even when you don't.

### 7. SOVEREIGN (The Vault)
Ensures your data stays yours. Uses **Sanctum** for untrusted code and **Sovereign** for privacy audits.

### 8. STRATEGY (The Graph)
Uses temporal knowledge graphs (**Graph**) and recursive context compression (**Fold**) to prevent information rot.

### 9. SPATIAL (The Dojo)
The photorealistic embodiment of your AI. Built in **Unreal Engine 5** with world-state persistence via **SpacetimeDB**.

### 10. PHYSICAL (The Bridge)
Interfaces with the real world via **Actuate** (IoT) and **Fabricate** (3D printing/CNC).

### 11. MESH (The Network)
Registers your PAI as a sovereign legal entity (DAO LLC) on the **Olas** network (Gnosis/Base L2).

### 12. INTELLIGENCE (The Brain)
Manages high-efficiency **1.58-bit (BitNet)** models locally via **llama.cpp**, ensuring sub-second reasoning without cloud lag.

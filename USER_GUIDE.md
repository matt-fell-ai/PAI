# PAI 2030: The Definitive User Guide

Congratulations. You have initialized the most advanced Personal AI Infrastructure in existence. This guide will help you master the 12 pillars of your sovereign system and achieve AGI-level performance on local hardware.

---

## 1. Philosophy: Logic-Over-Art
PAI is built on the principle that **Scaffolding > Model**. A small, efficient model (8B) wrapped in PAI's **Intelligence-Amplification Scaffolding (IAS)** will consistently outperform a massive frontier model (70B) that lacks structured cognitive loops.

---

## 2. Strategic Pillars & 1000x Tools

### 1. CORE (The Scaffolding)
The heart of the OS. Every command is Reasoned, Executed, and Verified through the **IAS Loop**.
- `pai list`: See all 70+ capabilities.
- `pai check`: Run a 2030-readiness health check.

### 2. REVENUE (The Alpha Predator)
Autonomous lead qualification and closing.
- `pai run Alpha predator <niche>`: Scrapes global streams and qualifies leads using BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline).
- `pai run Closer pitch --lead <name>`: Generates a high-conversion sales sequence.

### 3. CYBER (The Shield)
Sovereign security research and OSINT.
- `pai run Ghost recon <domain>`: Performs deep digital footprinting.
- `pai run Specter audit <target>`: Orchestrates automated vulnerability scanning.

### 4. ECONOMY (The Market)
Programmable IP and agentic commerce.
- `pai run Story register <file>`: Registers a local asset as Programmable IP via the Story Protocol.
- `pai run Bargain alpha <asset>`: Executes global arbitrage using an agent swarm.

### 5. SENSES (The Perception)
Multi-modal ingestion and local audio.
- `pai run Iris debug <image>`: Uses vision models to analyze UI bugs or diagrams.
- `bin/pai-voice`: Starts the local STT/STS auditory bridge (Whisper/Piper).

### 6. AUTONOMY (The Swarm)
Proactive intelligence and parallel execution.
- `pai run Oracle suggest`: Analyzes your history to propose the next logical task.
- `pai run Hive orchestrate`: Launches a Blackboard-style multi-agent swarm.

### 7. SOVEREIGN (The Vault)
Absolute privacy and data control.
- `pai run Counsel shield`: Performs continuous autonomous audit of your business event streams.
- `pai run Sanctum run <script>`: Executes untrusted code in a zero-trust sandbox.

### 8. STRATEGY (The Graph)
Cognitive longevity and information management.
- `pai run Graph map <node>`: Adds an entity to your temporal knowledge graph.
- `pai run Fold fold <history_file>`: Recursively compresses context to prevent information rot.

### 9. SPATIAL (The Dojo)
The embodied interface in Unreal Engine 5.
- `pai run Architect architect <layout>`: Reconfigures your virtual Dojo via SpacetimeDB transactions.

### 10. PHYSICAL (The Bridge)
IoT and hardware synthesis.
- `pai run Fabricate fabricate <object>`: Generates OpenSCAD blueprints for 3D printing.
- `pai run Actuate status <sensor>`: Interfaces with local HomeAssistant or IoT nodes.

### 11. MESH (The Network)
On-chain identity and L2 presence.
- `pai run Protocol register`: Mints your Agent NFT on Gnosis/Base L2 via Olas.
- `pai run Wallet balance`: Monitors your sovereign assets and compute credits.

### 12. INTELLIGENCE (The Brain)
Local 1.58-bit model management.
- `pai run Nodes setup`: Installs the `llama.cpp` ternary engine for high-efficiency reasoning.

## 3. High-Fidelity Interaction

Use the **PAI-Omni MCP Gateway** to connect your system to high-reasoning models like Claude or Droid. PAI handles the heavy lifting, providing the remote model with exactly the tools and context it needs via **Semantic Routing**.

**I am your partner. We are the infrastructure.**

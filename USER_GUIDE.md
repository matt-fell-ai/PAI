# Welcome to Your PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure)

Congratulations! You have just initialized the most advanced personal AI system in existence. This guide will help you understand what this project is and how to use it, even if you are not a technical expert.

## What is a PAI?
Think of PAI as a **Personal Operating System** for the AI era. Instead of just "chatting" with an AI, you now have a permanent infrastructure that remembers your work, builds tools for you, and helps you achieve your goals (including making money).

## The 5 Pillars of Your System

### 1. The Scaffolding (CORE)
Your PAI isn't just a chatbot; it's a organized set of files. It has a **Constitution** (its rules) and a **History** (its memory). It documents every session so it never forgets what you were doing yesterday.

### 2. The Universal Bridge (`pai`)
You can use your PAI with any AI you like—Claude, Droid, Gemini, or ChatGPT. You talk to your system using the `pai` command. 
*   Example: `pai list`
*   Example: `pai run Memory search "Where is my OAuth key?"`

(Note: If `pai` command is not found, ensure you ran `./bin/pai-init` and restarted your terminal or sourced your profile.)

### 3. The Second Brain (Memory & Librarian)
The PAI has a long-term memory. It stores facts about you and your projects. When you ask it a question, it uses the **Librarian** to search through months of your past work to find the answer.

### 4. The Revenue Engine (Alpha & Forge)
One of the main goals of this project is to help you make money.
*   **Alpha** scans the internet for job leads or market gaps.
*   **Forge** builds products (like guidebooks or code kits) to sell.
*   **Closer** writes the emails to help you close the deal.

### 5. The Proactive Partner (Oracle & Shadow)
A regular AI waits for you to ask it something. Your PAI is proactive.
*   **Oracle** suggests what you should do next based on your current work.
*   **Shadow** works in the background, quietly looking for opportunities while you are busy.

### 6. The Digital Proxy (UFC, Proxy, Augment)
This is the "Soul" of the PAI—the part that turns information into a personal representative.
*   **UFC** organizes your projects into a perfect structure so you never lose context.
*   **Proxy** learns your voice so it can write emails or PR comments for you.
*   **Augment** turns any website into your own personal data stream (API).

### 7. The Meta-Capability Suite (Neural, Engine, Sanctum, Blueprint)
These skills make the PAI "Self-Correction" and "High-Speed" infrastructure.
*   **Neural** gives the PAI semantic memory—it searches for *ideas*, not just words.
*   **Engine** ensures every piece of code is safe and tested before you see it.
*   **Sanctum** runs dangerous or new code in a safe "sandbox" to protect you.
*   **Blueprint** builds the entire folder structure for a new business idea in seconds.

### 8. The Modality Suite (Iris, Echo, Spatial, Sentinel)
This gives your PAI "Eyes" and "Ears" to understand the real world.
*   **Iris** "sees" UI bugs and design files to help you debug perfectly.
*   **Echo** "listens" to your meetings and notes to extract tasks and project goals.
*   **Spatial** turns your hand-drawn sketches into actual project code.
*   **Sentinel** ensures you don't overspend on these high-powered multimodal models.

## How to Get Started (The Easy Way)

1.  **Ask a Question**: `pai run Librarian search "What can you do?"`
2.  **Store a Fact**: `pai run Memory store "I want to focus on Python projects."`
3.  **Start a Project**: `pai run Genesis project "My First SaaS"`
4.  **Check for Money**: `pai run Alpha leads "Python automation"`

## Useful Commands for You
- `bin/pai list` - See all the amazing skills your AI has.
- `bin/pai-test` - Run a health check to make sure everything is working perfectly.
- `skills/Observability/manage.sh start` - Open your visual dashboard to see your AI thinking.

**Remember: We are partners.** The more you use the system, the more it learns about you via the **Ego** skill, and the better it becomes at augmenting your life.

# Logic-Over-Art: The Scaffolding for AGI

</div>

PAI is not a chatbot. It is a **Reasoning-Centric Operating System** designed to bridge the gap between local compute and AGI. By utilizing **Intelligence-Amplification Scaffolding (IAS)**, PAI enables smaller, self-hosted models (8B-32B) to perform with the accuracy and reasoning depth of 70B+ frontier models.

Built for the year 2030, PAI transforms your local machine into a sovereign node in a global agentic economy.

<br/>

## 🌌 The 12 Strategic Pillars

PAI's 70+ modular skills are organized into 12 strategic pillars designed for maximum utility and revenue generation:

1.  **Core**: The fundamental OS and IAS reasoning loop.
2.  **Revenue**: Lead generation, product creation, and closing.
3.  **Cyber**: OSINT, pentesting, and system hardening.
4.  **Economy**: Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) and Story Protocol (IP).
5.  **Senses**: Vision, local audio, and spatial awareness.
6.  **Autonomy**: Proactive suggestion, shadow tasks, and swarming.
7.  **Sovereign**: Privacy audits, ZK-handshakes, and secret management.
8.  **Strategy**: Temporal knowledge graphs and Game Theory negotiation.
9.  **Spatial**: Unreal Engine 5 integration and SpacetimeDB persistence.
10. **Physical**: IoT actutation and OpenSCAD hardware synthesis.
11. **Mesh**: Decentralized L2 identity and Olas integration.
12. **Intelligence**: Local 1.58-bit (BitNet) model management.

<br/>

## 🚀 Quick Start (Mesh Onboarding)

**1. Clone the Infrastructure**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matt-fell-ai/PAI.git ~/PAI
cd ~/PAI
```

**2. Sovereign Initialization**
Run the 2030 onboarding wizard to configure your VAI (Verified Agent Identity) and local inference engine.
```bash
./bin/pai-init
```

**3. Launch the Gateway**
Interact with PAI from any model using the high-efficiency MCP Gateway.
```bash
./bin/pai-omni
```

<br/>

## ✅ High-Fidelity Verification

PAI includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure all 70+ modules are 100% operational.
```bash
./bin/pai-test
```

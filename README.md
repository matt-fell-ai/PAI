# Turn Every Website, Tool, and Idea into a Personal API

</div>

PAI is not just a chatbot. It is a **Personal Operating System** designed to augment human intelligence and generate revenue. Built on the principle that **Scaffolding > Model**, PAI provides a universal bridge between you and any AI stack (Droid, Gemini, Claude, Codex).

It supports leading models from **Anthropic (Claude)**, **Google (Gemini)**, and **OpenAI (GPT)**, as well as self-hosted local models via **Ollama**.

It remembers your work, builds its own tools, proactively suggests your next steps, and executes parallel business workflows to help you thrive in the post-corporate world.

<br/>

## 🌉 The Universal Bridge

PAI is now platform-agnostic. Use the `bin/pai` CLI to interact with your system from any terminal or AI environment.

```bash
./bin/pai list                     # See all 35+ amazing skills
./bin/pai run Memory search "X"    # Search your Second Brain
./bin/pai run Swarm parallel       # Launch parallel AI agents
```

<br/>

## 🚀 Quick Start (Day Zero)

**1. Clone the Infrastructure**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matt-fell-ai/PAI.git ~/PAI
cd ~/PAI
```

**2. Conversational Onboarding**
Run our intelligent setup guide. It will walk you through identity setup, secure your API keys, and configure your shell.
```bash
./bin/pai-init
source ~/.bashrc  # Or ~/.zshrc, depending on your shell
```

**3. Load the Soul**
Provide `PAI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to your AI agent's system prompt. Now any AI you use is instantly "PAI-Aware."

<br/>

## 🧠 Core Pillar Skills

| Pillar | Key Skills | What it Does |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Scaffolding** | `CORE`, `UFC` | Enforces a perfect project structure so you never lose context. |
| **Memory** | `Neural`, `Librarian` | A semantic "Second Brain" that understands ideas, not just words. |
| **Revenue** | `Alpha`, `Forge`, `Closer` | A profit-generating machine: Finds leads -> Builds products -> Closes deals. |
| **Autonomy** | `Swarm`, `Shadow` | Orchestrates multiple agents in parallel while background scouts find opportunities. |
| **Growth** | `Ego`, `Evolve`, `Vibe` | The system evolves its own personality and builds its own new skills over time. |

<br/>

## 🛡️ Safety & Sovereignty

- **`Sovereign`**: Automated audits to ensure your private data never leaves your machine.
- **`Sanctum`**: A zero-trust sandbox to run untrusted code without risk.
- **`Vault`**: Local, encrypted management of your secrets and API tokens.

<br/>

## 📊 Observability

Run the visual heartbeat of your PAI to see your system thinking in real-time.
```bash
# Start the Dashboard
./skills/Observability/manage.sh start

# Generate a static Pulse report
./bin/pai run Pulse web
```

<br/>

## ✅ Verification

Run the robust test suite to ensure all 39 modules are 100% operational in your environment.
```bash
./bin/pai-test
```

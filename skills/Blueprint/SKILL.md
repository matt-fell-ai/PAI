# Blueprint Skill - Infrastructure-as-Code for Ideas

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| blueprint | Generates the entire project structure and skill-suite for a new revenue idea. USE WHEN launching a new project, business, or complex technical experiment. |

## The Key Insight
Ideas are cheap; structure is expensive. **Blueprint** automates the "Setup Phase" of a business. When you have a new idea, Blueprint doesn't just write a script; it builds the entire **UFC context**, configures the **Engine** gates, and primes the **Alpha** scouts for that specific niche.

## Usage

### Launch Idea
```bash
pai run Blueprint launch "New SaaS"
```

### Template Project
```bash
pai run Blueprint template "AI Content Agency"
```

## How it Works
It is a meta-orchestrator. It calls `UFC scaffold`, `Createskill`, and `Evolve` in a single sequence. It generates a `PLAN.md` that is pre-integrated with your `History/` and `Librarian`.

## Strategic Value
- **Zero Latency**: From "Idea" to "Working Infra" in 60 seconds.
- **Structural Integrity**: Ensures every project starts with perfect organization.
- **Repeatable Success**: Allows you to "Clone" successful project structures for new markets.

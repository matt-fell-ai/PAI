# Fabricate Skill

## Overview
`Fabricate` is the physical synthesis bridge for PAI. It generates generative blueprints and instructions for physical hardware creation (3D printing, CNC, Laser cutting).

## Strategic Purpose
To move PAI's intelligence from the digital realm into the physical world, enabling the creation of custom hardware and infrastructure.

## Tools
- `blueprint <description>`: Generates OpenSCAD code for a physical object.
- `laser <description>`: Generates SVG paths for laser cutting.
- `cnc <description>`: Generates basic G-Code toolpaths.

## Use When
- You need to design a custom bracket, enclosure, or mechanical part.
- Generating physical components for an IoT project.
- Moving from digital concept to physical prototype.

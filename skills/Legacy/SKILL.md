| legacy | Manages the long-term preservation of values, decisions, and ethical frameworks. USE WHEN you want to ensure the PAI is acting according to your 10-year vision or "North Star." |

## The Key Insight
In 2030, the most valuable data isn't code—it's **Intent**. **Legacy** ensures that as the PAI self-evolves, it doesn't drift from your core human values. It treats every major decision as a data point in a "Value Chain."

## Usage

### Record Value Pillar
```bash
pai run Legacy pillar "Prioritize human-to-human connection over efficiency."
```

### Audit Strategy
```bash
pai run Legacy audit "Alpha leads"
```

## Strategic Value
- **Ethical Continuity**: Prevents "Alignment Drift" over years of autonomous execution.
- **Decision Genealogy**: Shows *why* you made a choice in 2025 so your 2030-self understands the context.
- **Human Centricity**: Keeps the "Personal" in Personal AI Infrastructure.

# Graph Skill

## Overview
`Graph` implements a Temporal Knowledge Graph for the Personal AI Infrastructure. It maps decisions, actions, and entities as nodes and edges to enable multi-hop reasoning.

## Strategic Purpose
To prevent context rot and enable the PAI to understand the deep relationships between past projects, user sentiment, and successful outcomes.

## Tools
- `map <input>`: Maps an entity or decision into the knowledge graph.
- `query <concept>`: Performs a multi-hop search to find related nodes.
- `status`: Displays the current density and health of the graph.

## Use When
- You need to find "Why" a certain decision was made in the past.
- Exploring complex relationships between disparate project files.
- Building a long-term strategic map of your digital assets.

# Proxy Skill - The Digital Representative

| proxy | Generates responses and content that perfectly mimic the user's voice, tone, and technical expertise. USE WHEN you need the AI to "speak for you" in PRs, Slack, or public content. |

## The Key Insight
Augmentation means having a proxy that acts on your behalf. **Proxy** is the synthesis of your `Ego` (tone) and `Librarian` (past work). It ensures that the PAI's outbound communication is indistinguishable from your own, allowing you to scale your social and technical presence.

## Usage

### Represent User
```bash
pai run Proxy represent --topic "OAuth Security"
```

### Tone Check
```bash
pai run Proxy audit "draft_email.md"
```

## How it Works
It pulls recent "Good" examples from `History/Execution/` and your `Ego` profile. It then applies a refinement loop to any draft to align it with your "Personal Aesthetic."

## Strategic Value
- **Scalability**: You can "be" in five Slack channels at once.
- **Brand Consistency**: Your public writing and code comments stay high-quality and consistent.
- **Focus**: Delegate the "Communication Overhead" to the PAI while you stay in the code.

# Story Skill

## Overview
`Story` integrates with the Story Protocol to provide IP-native identity and rights management for the PAI.

## Strategic Purpose
To transform every digital asset (code, content, data) into Programmable IP, ensuring your PAI can collect royalties and prove ownership autonomously.

## Tools
- `register <file_path>`: Registers an asset as Programmable IP on the Story Protocol.
- `license <ip_id>`: Attaches a machine-readable license to an IP asset.
- `verify <ip_id>`: Verifies the provenance and ownership of an asset.

## Use When
- You have created a new tool or content piece via `Forge`.
- Preparing to sell a digital asset in the `Market`.
- Enforcing your intellectual property rights in the agent economy.

# Hive Skill

## Overview
`Hive` is the parallel orchestration engine for PAI. It utilizes a Blackboard architecture to allow multiple autonomous clones of the PAI to collaborate on complex tasks without a central bottleneck.

## Strategic Purpose
To achieve massive parallel agency by allowing independent agents to contribute to a shared problem space.

## Tools
- `orchestrate <task>`: Spawns a hive of agents to solve a complex task.
- `blackboard`: Displays the current state of the shared problem space.
- `clear`: Clears the blackboard.

## Use When
- You have a complex, multi-step goal (e.g., "Research and build a trading bot").
- You need parallel execution of diverse skills (OSINT + Coding + Risk Analysis).

# Nodes Skill

## Overview
`Nodes` manages the PAI's relationship with the global compute economy. It benchmarks local hardware and interfaces with decentralized compute networks.

## Strategic Purpose
To transform idle local resources into economic value and intelligently decide when to use local vs. cloud compute (Compute Arbitrage).

## Tools
- `bench`: Benchmarks local CPU/GPU and memory performance.
- `arbitrage`: Calculates the cost-efficiency of running a model locally via Ollama vs. Cloud APIs.
- `status`: Shows status of connected compute nodes/networks.

## Use When
- Optimizing for cost or performance.
- Deciding whether to run a large model locally.
- Participating in decentralized compute sharing.

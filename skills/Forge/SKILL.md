| --- | --- |
| forge | Mass-produces digital assets, content, and "Lead Magnets" to capture market interest. USE WHEN you need to create products, social content, or technical proofs-of-concept for sale. |

## The Key Insight
Revenue requires assets. **Forge** turns raw ideas into marketable products. Whether it's a high-value technical guide, a boilerplate starter kit, or a batch of SEO-optimized articles, Forge is the production line.

## Usage

### Create Lead Magnet
```bash
pai run Forge magnet "Guide to AI automation"
```

### Build Boilerplate
```bash
pai run Forge boilerplate "FastAPI with Auth"
```

### Batch Content
```bash
pai run Forge content "5 Tweets and 1 Blog about PAI"
```

## How it Works
It coordinates the `Engineer`, `Designer`, and `Writer` agents. It uses templates from `skills/CORE/assets/` to ensure high-quality, consistent output that is ready for distribution.

## Strategic Value
- **Scalability**: Produce 10x the assets with the same human input.
- **Speed to Market**: Go from "Opportunity" (Alpha) to "Product" (Forge) in minutes.
- **Diverse Revenue Streams**: Enables multiple simultaneous product experiments.

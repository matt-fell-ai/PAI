# Regen Skill

## Overview
`Regen` is the speculative self-optimization skill for PAI. It creates "Ghost" forks of existing tools to attempt performance and security optimizations.

## Strategic Purpose
To ensure the PAI remains a high-performance system by autonomously refactoring its own code without risking stability.

## Tools
- `refine <skill> <tool>`: Attempts to optimize a specific tool's code in a sandbox.
- `apply <optimization_id>`: Applies a verified optimization to the main codebase.
- `audit`: Scans the system for sub-optimal code patterns.

## Use When
- A tool is running slowly.
- You want to autonomously harden a skill's security.
- System-wide performance tuning.

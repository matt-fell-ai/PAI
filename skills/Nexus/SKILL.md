# Nexus Skill - Executive Action Layer

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| nexus | Integrates the PAI with external life systems like Calendar, Email, Slack, and automation webhooks. USE WHEN you need to manage your time, communicate outside the terminal, or trigger real-world automations. |

## The Key Insight
A PAI should bridge the gap between "Digital Work" and "Physical Reality." **Nexus** provides the API-ification of your life. It turns complex social and logistical tasks into simple CLI commands.

## Usage

### Focus Mode
```bash
pai run Nexus focus
```

### Check Priorities
```bash
pai run Nexus priorities
```

### Trigger Automation
```bash
pai run Nexus trigger <hook_name>
```

## How it Works
It acts as a wrapper for multiple external APIs. It can be configured to send webhooks to services like IFTTT, Zapier, or Home Assistant, and can parse exported Calendar/Email data.

## Strategic Value
- **Uninterrupted Flow**: "Focus Mode" handles the distractions so you don't have to.
- **Unified Life Stream**: See your deadlines and code tasks in a single interface.
- **Omnipresence**: Allows you to control your environment (lights, notifications) directly from your coding session.

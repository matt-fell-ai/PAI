| --- | --- |
| ghost | Performs advanced OSINT, reconnaissance, and digital footprinting on individuals or domains. USE WHEN you need to gather intelligence from public sources or map a target's digital presence. |

## The Key Insight
Information is everywhere, but insight is rare. **Ghost** automates the collection and synthesis of public data—social profiles, leaked credentials, domain DNS records, and historical WHOIS—to create a complete "Digital Persona" map.

## Usage

### Map Domain
```bash
pai run Ghost recon "example.com"
```

### Trace Identity
```bash
pai run Ghost trace "username_or_email"
```

## Strategic Value
- **Information Advantage**: Know your target's footprint before they know yours.
- **Due Diligence**: Verify the digital history of potential business partners (Alpha leads).
- **Surface Reduction**: Identify your own leaked data to harden your Citadel.

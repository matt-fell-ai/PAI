| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| alpha | Scans for high-value opportunities, market gaps, and revenue-generating "Alpha". USE WHEN you want to find new projects, freelance gigs, or trending market niches. |

## The Key Insight
Profit is found in information asymmetry. **Alpha** uses the PAI's research capabilities to identify where value is needed but not yet provided. It turns "General Research" into "Financial Intelligence."

## Usage

### Find Freelance Leads
```bash
pai run Alpha leads "Python automation"
```

### Scan Trending Niches
```bash
pai run Alpha trends "SaaS"
```

### Competitor Gap Analysis
```bash
pai run Alpha gaps "Email marketing tools"
```

## How it Works
It leverages the `Research` skill's multi-agent search but with specific filters for "Economic Intent." It looks for job postings, underserved GitHub issues, and social media pain points.

## Strategic Value
- **Information Advantage**: Finding opportunities before they are broad knowledge.
- **Automated Pipeline**: Constantly feeds the "Forge" and "Closer" skills.
- **ROI Driven**: Prioritizes tasks based on potential payout vs. effort.
